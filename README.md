# Collaborative learning sessions

Jake Gillberg organized a collaborative learning group around the pi calculus in April 2018. This repository is for the slides and other materials supporting the study group. The group follows along with Robin Milner's [Polyadic Pi Calculus: A Tutorial ](http://www.lfcs.inf.ed.ac.uk/reports/91/ECS-LFCS-91-180/ECS-LFCS-91-180.ps).
